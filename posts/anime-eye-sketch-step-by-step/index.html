While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=how-to-draw-and-shade-anime-eyes-step-by-step-drawing-guide-by>How To Draw And Shade Anime Eyes, Step By Step, Drawing Guide, By<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-draw-and-shade-anime-eyes-step-by-step-drawing-guide-by>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.dragoart.com/images/174600_502/how-to-draw-and-shade-anime-eyes-step-11_5e4cd3ec61bc94.19754328_103196_5_3.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.HMhYJDz9HHXYjESIYEkRRQHaG7&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="How To Draw And Shade Anime Eyes, Step by Step, Drawing Guide, by"><p><em>Source: dragoart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>eyes anime draw step shade drawing guide dragoart.</p></blockquote><p>The Best Way to Store Wallpapers: A Storage Solution for Your Collection
